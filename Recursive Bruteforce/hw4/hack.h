We can have one function for all users, or have different functions for each user. Here we are using one function for each User.

In these functions, we pass EvilComputer* ec as one of the input as well
so that you can check if the string that you generating is the password for the user.
For example:

(*ec).guess("Guest", "passw123"); is going to check if the password of the guest is passw123
and if it is correct, mark guest as hacked

(*ec).is_hacked("Dave") is returning boolean if you want to check Dave is hacked or not.
Do you think that would be a good method for one of the base cases in recursion? :D
